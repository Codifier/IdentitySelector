Identity Selector is an extension for Thunderbird that prompts you to select the correct identity before composing a message.

The available identities in the prompt window are neatly organized by account. The prompt window can be enabled/disabled for new, reply, forward, and draft messages.

Identity Selector will furthermore warn you about the following cases if you want to reply to or forward a message:

- If the original message was sent to a non-existent identity (e.g. received by a catch-all address); it will use heuristics to show you potential new identity addresses for to you to create before proceeding.
- If the original message was sent to an identity belonging to another account than your current account; your current account will always appear emphasized in the accounts list.
